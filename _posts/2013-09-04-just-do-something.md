I've been programming for a long time. The first time I wrote any code at all was when I was seven years old. My father was a programmer, and in 1984 he bought our first home computer -- an Atari 800XL. It was basically a bulky keyboard with an Atari cartidge slot above the keys. There was no monitor, either; you just plugged it into a TV.

For New Year's Eve, he showed me how to write a program that would scroll the words "HAPPY NEW YEAR - 1984!" across the bottom of the screen at midnight. Like a Fischer Price "My First Cron Job". I thought that was the coolest thing ever.

Over the next couple of years, I dabbled with programming a little. Drawing a pixel turtle that would crawl around the screen was one I remember sweating over for days. But I used the computer mostly for playing video games. Text-based RPG's, horrible flight simulators, platformers like Conan and Mario Bros.

Later on, when I went to college for Engineering, I got back into programming, though. We had to take take classes in Fortran, and for other classes we were required to write code to solve problems in any language we wanted. For some bizarre reason, I chose to learn Visual Basic.

At my first internship, I used VB to automate AutoCAD models. Not because my boss asked me to, but because it was the easiest way to get the job done. Writing code was fun, sure, but it was also really efficient. Maybe that's why it was fun. I don't really know. Then at my first real job out of school, I wrote in VB, Fortran, Matlab, and a little C and Java. Again, it was just the easiest way to get stuff done.

To be perfectly clear, I was never great at this. I never studied how to write code cleanly, how to write and run tests, what a functional language or an object-oriented language was, or when you should use different languages for things. I just wrote code however I knew how, using whatever language was available for the task. But programming started to get fun in its own right, at this point. A few years ago, I started learning some PHP and Javascript, so I could build some websites.

Having spent years looking at code, and eventually even writing usable software for other people, I decided to quit engineering and work in the tech world. I'm more of a people person and a teacher than I am a developer, though, so I got a job in technical customer support.

I got a job at GitHub.

It was a huge jump. From aerospace engineering work for the DoD to tech support at GitHub, a huge name in the developer community. It felt really strange. I've been at GitHub for nine months now and it *still* feels strange. I'm surrounded by all these people who are not only cool and fun to work with, but are incredible developers. It's intimidating.

And that, after that long introduction, is what this post is really all about. I'm totally intimidated by my coworkers.

I haven't written any code in nine months. Partly because I'm busy -- there's a lot of work to do, so I have less free time than I had at my old government job. Partly, though, I'm embarrassed by the code I write. I'm kind of ashamed to be writing it, even if I'm the only one that sees it.

This is probably not an uncommon feeling, though. I'm sure there are other people who would love to hack on something, but are uncomfortable with their ability to do it. So they just don't. And this sucks.

No matter what your skill level is, there's surely some project you can throw together to get started. It doesn't have to be perfect, or even complete. Just get started. Because that's the only way you're going to get better. Maybe you don't have any projects of your own. That's fine, because there are tons of open source projects that could use more help. Instead of being embarrassed and afraid of criticism, you should welcome the help that other people can offer. There are developers out there who are better than you, and they have a lot to teach you.

So whether you're editing documentation, testing for bugs, writing new test suites, or hacking on something just for fun, don't be embarrassed or intimidated.

And this goes for me, too. There are a couple of things I'd like to write for my own use that I just haven't done. I've been wasting my time being intimidated when my coworkers could have been helping me and teaching me this whole time. Well, I'm going to get cracking. And I'm going to host my projects on GitHub for all the world to see. The code might be ugly and riddled with bugs. It might even be redundant because someone else out there wrote something better. I don't care; I'm doing it anyway.

Here's my resolution to get back to coding. Because it's fun and I have a lot to learn.

*Even though I'm talking about programming, this applies to just about everything in life. Don't be embarrassed by your skill level. And don't be overly confident, either. There's always someone who has something to teach you. Find them and learn something.*
